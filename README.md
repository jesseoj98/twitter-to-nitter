# Twitter to Nitter

Simple extension that transforms Twitter domain URLs (twitter.com, mobile.twitter.com) into the Nitter domain URL (nitter.net). Currently only tested and developed to work with FireFox as an extension/add-on.

Nitter is a privacy-focused front-end "skin" for Twitter that has several features... my favorite being that it bypasses the need to create an account to view profiles. More information about the Nitter project [here](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter) or visit the Nitter website [here](https://nitter.net).
